# FlyWheel
A onewheel style motor-board made with parts from a hoverboard

## May 25th: Research!
I looked on Facebook Marketplace for used hoverboards, and I found that I can probably get one for around $35-50.  
I also found this super good video for a possible way to make it. However, I think I might want to use a airless tire, possibly made with TPU. I need to do more research about tire material though.

I think Ill be able to make this for a little less than 150, which is perfect!

**Total time spent: 2h**

## June 10th: Research!
I looked at various 3d models and stuff, and I think the best option may be to make either a TPU tire, or to make a mold for silicone. Silicone seems to be the grippier material, so I think that seems like a better option.

**Total time spent: 4h**

## June 11th: Beginning of CAD!
I started the CAD model, especially the wheel, and it looks really good so far!

This is the whole assembly right now:

**Total time spent: 6h**

## June 12th: More CAD, and made a logo!
I made the footpads house the electronics, as well as made a cover for the electronics. I also colored in the model, so now it looks way better!

I also made a logo in Figma, heres how it is so far:

Im also starting to work on a BOM: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjflP9YCtFkJdnlUvsTnhEtVfswnPUGQap1I6gtcne4/edit?usp=sharing    

**Total time spent: 9h**

## June 15th: Some BOM and a tad of CAD!

I think I found a good option for the hoverboard from marketplace! It also seems that itll probably be cheapest/about the same price to get everything from Amazon.  
Total seems to be about $130, but it may be less since the hoverboard itself (depending on what I settle on) may be cheaper than my estimated $50, that is just the max I am willing to spend on it.

For CAD, I added ridges to the tops of the footpads to add grip.  
I tried to do simulations in fusion, but it didnt really work since idk what im doing.
