# FlyWheel
A onewheel style motor-board made with parts from a hoverboard

## May 25th: Research!
I looked on Facebook Marketplace for used hoverboards, and I found that I can probably get one for around $35-50.  
I also found this super good video for a possible way to make it. However, I think I might want to use a airless tire, possibly made with TPU. I need to do more research about tire material though.

I think Ill be able to make this for a little less than 150, which is perfect!

**Total time spent: 2h**

## June 10th: Research!
I looked at various 3d models and stuff, and I think the best option may be to make either a TPU tire, or to make a mold for silicone. Silicone seems to be the grippier material, so I think that seems like a better option.

**Total time spent: 4h**

## June 11th: Beginning of CAD!
I started the CAD model, especially the wheel, and it looks really good so far!

This is the whole assembly right now:

**Total time spent: 6h**

## June 12th: More CAD, and made a logo!
I made the footpads house the electronics, as well as made a cover for the electronics. I also colored in the model, so now it looks way better!

I also made a logo in Figma, heres how it is so far:

Im also starting to work on a BOM: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjflP9YCtFkJdnlUvsTnhEtVfswnPUGQap1I6gtcne4/edit?usp=sharing    

**Total time spent: 9h**

## June 15th: Some BOM and a tad of CAD!

I think I found a good option for the hoverboard from marketplace! It also seems that itll probably be cheapest/about the same price to get everything from Amazon.  
Total seems to be about $130, but it may be less since the hoverboard itself (depending on what I settle on) may be cheaper than my estimated $50, that is just the max I am willing to spend on it.

For CAD, I added ridges to the tops of the footpads to add grip.  
I tried to do simulations in fusion, but it didnt really work since idk what im doing.

I also made a mold for the silicone tire, and bolts to hold it together

Theoretically, since the mold is chamfered, it should be pretty easy to pour in the silicone. Since the mold seperates into halves, it should also be easy to remove the tire when done, and the bolts serve as a way to align the two halves of the mold. Definitely going to need a ton of mold release!
