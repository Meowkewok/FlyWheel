# May 25th: Research!
I looked on Facebook Marketplace for used hoverboards, and I found that I can probably get one for around $35-50.  
I also found this super good video for a possible way to make it. However, I think I might want to use a airless tire, possibly made with TPU. I need to do more research about tire material though.

I think Ill be able to make this for a little less than 150, which is perfect!

# June 10th: Research!
I looked at various 3d models and stuff, and I think the best option may be to make either a TPU tire, or to make a mold for silicone. Silicone seems to be the grippier material, so I think that seems like a better option.

# June 11th: Beginning of CAD!
I started the CAD model, especially the wheel, and it looks really good so far!
