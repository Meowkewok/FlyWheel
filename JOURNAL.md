# May 25th: Research!
I looked on Facebook Marketplace for used hoverboards, and I found that I can probably get one for around $35-50.  
I also found this super good video for a possible way to make it. However, I think I might want to use a airless tire, possibly made with TPU. I need to do more research about tire material though.

I think Ill be able to make this for a little less than 150, which is perfect!

**Total time spent: 2h**
