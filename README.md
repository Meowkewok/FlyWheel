# FlyWheel
Designed by @Meowkewok  
A onewheel style motor-board made from 3d printed parts and a hoverboard! It also uses an airless tire!  
Overall, this project should be less than $150!  

**BOM:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjflP9YCtFkJdnlUvsTnhEtVfswnPUGQap1I6gtcne4/edit?usp=sharing  
**CAD:** https://a360.co/43ZN17t  
Read the journal for development information!  

I made this project because I have admired onewheels' versatility and coolness for some time, but they are prohibitively expensive, so once I saw a video about putting hoverboard motors into a gokart wheel, I thought: Wow! That seems like it would be a way to make a onewheel!

All CAD was made using Fusion360.  
This project was made for Hack Club's Highway! Check it out here: https://highway.hackclub.com/
